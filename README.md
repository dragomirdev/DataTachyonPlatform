# DataTachyonPlatform

## Introduction

Data Tachyon Platform (DTP) is a software solution that provides a layered architecture for the delivery of end-to-end enterprise software projects.

## Architectural Layers

### Integration

The Integration Layer enables the connectivity with the back-end systems like RDBMS, IOT, Cloud Databases and any other current or legacy data sources.

### Data

The Data Layer is used to store any data, clean and enrich the datasets coming from the Integration Layer and provide backup capabilities.

### Business

The Business Layer is used to apply business logic to the datasets and create new data insights using Artificial Intelligence with Real-Time and Batch-Type systems.

### Presentation

The Presentation Layer is used to visualise results and provide new data insights that are coming from the Business Layer.
Visualisations can be expressed in a traditional 2D/3D format or 3D in a Virtual Reality format.

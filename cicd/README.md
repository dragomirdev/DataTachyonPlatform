Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment(CICD):

Continuous Integration:(CI)
It is used integrate code into a shared repository used by developers. 
Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. 
By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.

The DTP uses Jenkins a free, open-source, Java-based tool that gives you a lot of flexibility.

Continuous Delivery: (CD):
It is the ability to get changes of all typesâ€”including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes. 
This is achieve all this by ensuring our code is always in a deployable state, 
 even in the face of teams of thousands of developers making changes on a daily basis.

Installation of DTP using CI/CD with Jenkins:
Using CI/CD with Jenkins, The following DTP software components are installed on the Target VM.
* Data Layer including spark and hadoop
* Business Layer involving the AI Software packages.
* Integration layer like Nifi, Spark
* Presentation Layer like  Elasticsearch, logstash, kibana.
